    "Answer the question: How many AD risk loci overlap (via fine-mapping credible sets) and/or formally colocalize (via colocalization confident sets) with various xQTL modalities and contexts? This analysis aims to quantify the extent to which Alzheimer's disease risk loci can be 'explained' through molecular quantitative trait loci across multiple biological contexts and data types."
